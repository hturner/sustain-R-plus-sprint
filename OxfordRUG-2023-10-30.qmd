::: {.column width="70%"}
- R is a programming language for statistical computing and data science
- Originally developed by academics, now widely used across sectors and domains
- Used for critical “production” applications (e.g., COVID-19 modelling), as well as prototyping
- Core R project underpins >20,000 packages
:::

## Sustainability

Those who contributed the most to R early on are now near the end of their careers, only partially replaced by new contributors.

```{r}
#| fig.align: center
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "r_core_commits.png"))
```


::: {.notes}
- Originally developed by academics, core R underpins >20,000 packages
- Early on, strong group of heavy committers supported by wide group of regular committers
- Heavy committers now towards end of their careers
- Regular committers only partially replaced by new members
-Similar for developer community

## Benefits of a diverse community

- Increasing innovation
- Increasing sustainability
- Decreased duplication of effort as people work together

. . . 

:::{.callout-note}
## Personal reflection
- A diverse, welcoming community is pleasurable to be involved in (as opposed to off-putting) 
- Motivates a desire to contribute.
:::

## R Contribution Working Group

Established July 2020

- Social media (Slack, Twitter, Mastodon)
- Novice-friendly documentation
- Short-term paid projects (GSoC, GSoD)
- Events for novice contributors

## R Project Sprint 2023: Preparation

## C book club for R contributors 

- For existing/aspiring R contributors that want to learn/refresh their C programming skills.
- May 16th--Aug 22nd, online every two weeks, 1-2pm BST Tuesdays
- Main reading is [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) by Jens Gustedt, supplemented by selected exercises from [C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/) by K. N. King.
- Commitment ~2hrs a week
- <https://github.com/r-devel/c-book-club/>

::: {.notes}
- Much of R is written in C
- Originally conceived for R Sprint participants, but open to all
- Modern C pdf freely available online
- At the online meetings, one book club member will present a summary of the chapter (~10 minutes), reviewing the main points and highlighting any quotes/examples they found particularly helpful/important. This will be followed by discussion, sharing exercise solutions, etc. Book club members are encouraged to sign up to present at one session to spread the load among the group.
- Possibly a second cohort 7-8pm PDT (3am BST!)
